    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> Safety constraints are essential for reinforcement learning (RL) applied in real-world situations. Chance constraints are suitable to represent the safety requirements in stochastic systems. Most existing RL methods with chance constraints have a low convergence rate, and only learn a conservative policy. In this paper, we propose a model-based chance constrained actor-critic (CCAC) algorithm which can efficiently learn a safe and non-conservative policy. Different from existing methods that optimize a conservative lower bound, CCAC directly solves the original chance constrained problems, where the objective function and safe probability is simultaneously optimized with adaptive weights. In order to improve the convergence rate, CCAC utilizes the gradient of dynamic model to accelerate policy optimization. The effectiveness of CCAC is demonstrated by an aggressive car-following task. Experiments indicate that compared with previous methods, CCAC improves the performance by 57.6% while guaranteeing safety, with a five times faster convergence rate. </p></div>

    Abstract
    </button>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> Transformer has achieved great successes in learning vision and language representation, which is general across various downstream tasks. In visual control, learning transferable state representation that can transfer between different control tasks is important to reduce the training sample size. However, porting Transformer to sample-efficient visual control remains a challenging and unsolved problem. To this end, we propose a novel Control Transformer (CtrlFormer), possessing many appealing benefits that prior arts do not have. Firstly, CtrlFormer jointly learns self-attention mechanisms between visual tokens and policy tokens among different control tasks, where multitask representation can be learned and transferred without catastrophic forgetting. Secondly , we carefully design a contrastive reinforcement learning paradigm to train CtrlFormer, enabling it to achieve high sample efficiency, which is important in control problems. For example, in the DMControl benchmark, unlike recent advanced methods that failed by producing a zero score in the "Cartpole" task after transfer learning with 100k samples, CtrlFormer can achieve a state-of-the-art score 769 Â±34 with only 100k samples, while maintaining the performance of previous tasks. The code and models are released in our project homepage. </p></div>

    Abstract

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> Safety is essential for reinforcement learning (RL) applied in real-world tasks like autonomous driving. Imposing chance constraints (or probabilistic constraints) is a suitable way to enhance RL safety under model uncertainty. Existing chance constrained RL methods like the penalty methods and the Lagrangian methods either exhibit periodic oscillations or learn an over-conservative or unsafe policy. In this paper, we address these shortcomings by elegantly combining these two methods and propose a separated proportional-integral Lagrangian (SPIL) algorithm. We first rewrite penalty methods as optimizing safe probability according to the proportional value of constraint violation, and Lagrangian methods as optimizing according to the integral value of the violation. Then we propose to add up both the integral and proportion values to optimize the policy, with an integral separation technique to limit the integral value within a reasonable range. Besides, the gradient of policy is computed in a model-based paradigm to accelerate training. The proposed method is proved to reduce oscillations and conservatism while ensuring safety by a car-following experiment. </p></div>

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> Reinforcement learning has the potential to control stochastic nonlinear systems in optimal manners successfully. We propose a mixed reinforcement learning (mixed RL) algorithm by simultaneously using dual representations of environmental dynamics to search the optimal policy. The dual representation includes an empirical dynamic model and a set of state-action data. The former can embed the designerâs knowledge and reduce the difficulty of learning, and the latter can be used to compensate the model inaccuracy since it reflects the real system dynamics accurately. Such a design has the capability of improving both learning accuracy and training speed.

    Abstract
    </button>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> Reinforcement learning (RL) methods often rely on massive exploration data to search optimal policies, and suffer from poor sampling efficiency. This paper presents a mixed reinforcement learning (mixed RL) algorithm by simultaneously using dual representations of environmental dynamics to search the optimal policy with the purpose of improving both learning accuracy and training speed. The dual representations indicate the environmental model and the state-action data: the former can accelerate the learning process of RL, while its inherent model uncertainty generally leads to worse policy accuracy than the latter, which comes from direct measurements of states and actions. In the framework design of the mixed RL, the compensation of the additive stochastic model uncertainty is embedded inside the policy iteration RL framework by using explored state-action data via iterative Bayesian estimator (IBE). The optimal policy is then computed in an iterative way by alternating between policy evaluation (PEV) and policy improvement (PIM). The convergence of the mixed RL is proved using the Bellman's principle of optimality, and the recursive stability of the generated policy is proved via the Lyapunov's direct method. The effectiveness of the mixed RL is demonstrated by a typical optimal control problem of stochastic non-affine nonlinear systems (ie, double lane change task with an automated vehicle). </p></div>

    Abstract
    </button>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p>  The latent dynamics model summarizes an agentâs high dimensional experiences in a compact way. While learning from imagined trajectories by the latent model is confirmed to has great potential to facilitate behavior learning, the lack of memory diversity limits generalization capability. Inspired by a neuroscience experiment of âforming artificial memories during sleepâ, we propose a robust memory augmentation method with Constrained Latent ImaginatiON (CLION) under a novel actor-critic framework, which aims to speed up the learning of the optimal policy with virtual episodic. Various experiments on high-dimensional visual control tasks with arbitrary image uncertainty demonstrate that CLION outperforms existing approaches in terms of data-efficiency, robustness to uncertainty, and final performance. </p></div>
